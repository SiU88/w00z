If you don't understand the rules, please ask a parent or someone who takes care of you to explain them to you. \nIt's really important!\n<br\/><br\/>\n1. Follow the rules of the game.\nWhen you sign up with Woozworld, you agree to follow the rules of the game. If you break any of these rules, your account will be closed and you won't be able to access our site again. Please read the complete Terms of Use and Privacy Policy with your parents, it's linked at the bottom of this screen.\n<br\/><br\/>\n2. Let your parents know that you're playing in Woozworld.\nWhen you want to play online, you should always have permission from a parent or the person who is looking after you. When you sign up, you must enter their e-mail address so that we can send them a message to inform them you created an account. You can explore the entire Woozworld universe and enjoy all its cool content and functionalities.\n<br\/><br\/>\n3. Select a character name that is different from your real name.\nTo play in Woozworld, you must invent a name that will be seen by everyone on the site.

If you want to use words that do not appear in the chat list, don't worry, because new words are being added all the time.\n<br\/><br\/>\n7. Report to us anyone who is behaving badly. \nIf someone is really bothering you, change your screen or do something else.
